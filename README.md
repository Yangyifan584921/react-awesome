这个项目是自动启动的通过 [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## 可执行脚本

在项目的根目录，你可以运行:

### `npm start`

通过开发模式启动app。<br>
在浏览器中打开 [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

当修改代码时页面会刷新<br>
你也能再控制台看到任何的lint错误信息。

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

如果你对构建工具和配置选择不满意, you can `eject` at any time. 这个命令将会从你的项目中删除构建单一的构建依赖项.

相反，它会将所有配置文件和传递依赖项（Webpack，Babel，ESLint等）复制到项目中，以便你可以完全控制它们。 All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand thatif you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it. this tool wouldn’t be useful
